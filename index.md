# Overview
<div style="text-align: justify">
This workshop will focus on computer vision algorithms using less labels and/or less data. 
Classically, machine learning relies on abundant annotated data. This is prone to cultural biases, since datasets are commonly recorded in western countries,  as well as distribution biais due to rare events, such as adverse weather/lighting conditions rarely included in datasets.

We will showcase recent researches on alternative strategies to reduce the need of labels (e.g., domain adaptation, domain generalization) or the need of data (few-/zero-shot learning, continual learning). Other strategies like self-supervised learning (cross modal, model-based), continual learning, etc. will be introduced. 
<br><br>

<b>The workshop will have a poster session for selected works. Relevant original and/or published works are welcome.<br>
Deadline for submissions is July 10th 2022 (<a href="#call-for-papers">call for paper</a>).</b>
